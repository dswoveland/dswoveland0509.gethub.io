            <dt>What is Git?</dt>
	<dd> Git is known as a "distributed" (rather than "centralized") version control system because you can run it locally and disconnected from the Internet, and then "push" your changes to a remote system (such as GitHub) whenever you like </dd>
            <dt>Who started Git? </dt>
						<dd>Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005. </dd>
					<dt>What is Hub? </dt>
						<dd> Both Git and GitHub refer to this as a repository, or “repo” for short, a digital directory or storage space where you can access your project, its files, and all the versions of its files that Git saves. A Readme file is usually a text file that explains a bit about the project </dd>  
					<dt>Describe Repository and its role? </dt>
						<dd> Generically refers to a central place where data is stored and maintained. A repository can be a place where multiple databases or files are located for distribution over a network, or a repository can be a location that is directly accessible to the user without having to travel across a network. </dd> 
					<dt>Your thoughts about GitHub. </dt>
						<dd> I think it’s a great tool that, allows for mass distribution of code, and collaboration of different versions of source code mods. </dd>
